# Link Prediction and Cascading within subreddits

Course Project, Presentations of Statistical Machine Learning Course of Arizona State University

• Created a graph using reddit data where each node is a subreddit and each edge is a hyperlink between them
• Designed an algorithm that generates the probability of an edge (hyperlink) connecting two nodes
• Designed a feature vector based on classical link prediction algorithms
• Used gradient boosting method for link prediction in the graphs
• Provided empirical results to show good results can be achieved in link prediction problems without the use of more sophisticated node-feature extraction methods such 
as node2vec.
